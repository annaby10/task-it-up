## 📂 Project Structure

| File         | Description                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| `index.html` | Basic structure and input layout     |
| `todoapp.js` | JavaScript to handle task actions    |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User types a task in the input box
2. On clicking "Add task", a new list item is created with a delete button
3. Clicking "delete" removes that specific task from the list

> 🎯 Bonus: Uses `querySelector`, `createElement`, `classList`, and `addEventListener` for DOM interaction!
